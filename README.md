## Introduction
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem in computer science and operations research. Given a list of cities and the distances between them, the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

This repository provides implementations of three search algorithms to solve the TSP:
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- A* Search

## Requirements
To compile and run the code, you need:
- [C++ compiler](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) 

## Usage
To use the TSP solver, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Paste-github/AI-HOMEWORK.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd AI-HOMEWORK`
3. Compile the code:
4. Run the executable: `./tsp_solver`
